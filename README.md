Honstestly I love sudoku. It is a great (usually bite sized) puzzle that is built on strict rules which can lead to some clever inevitabilities 
The idea behind this is to have first a text based solver and then possibly move on to a great way to show how algorithms can crack sudoku puzzles
First thing I am gonna grab a board (with zeros representing empty space) off of my favorite sudoku app so I know it is solveable and then I will work on a way of cracking it using a backtracking algorith 
will work on making a GUI soon
